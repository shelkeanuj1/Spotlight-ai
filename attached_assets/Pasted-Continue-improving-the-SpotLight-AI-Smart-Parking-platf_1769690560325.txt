Continue improving the SpotLight AI Smart Parking platform.

Upgrade the system from a UI demo to a fully functional smart mobility platform with working buttons, backend logic, database integration, and advanced features.

========================
1) MAKE EVERY BUTTON FUNCTIONAL
========================

For every button in the UI, implement real functionality:

- “Find Parking”:
  - Trigger parking prediction algorithm.
  - Update map markers and prediction panel dynamically.

- “Navigate”:
  - Open Google Maps directions using real coordinates:
    https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=USER_LAT,USER_LNG&destination=DEST_LAT,DEST_LNG

- “Refresh Predictions”:
  - Recalculate parking probabilities in real time.

- “View Details”:
  - Show modal with detailed information about selected parking spot.

- “Dark Mode”:
  - Toggle between light and dark themes.

- “City Selector”:
  - Change map focus and prediction logic based on selected city.

========================
2) BACKEND & DATABASE INTEGRATION
========================

Implement a real backend using Node.js + Express (or Replit built-in backend).

Database requirements:
- Use a simple database (SQLite / MongoDB / Replit DB).
- Store:
  - Parking spots
  - EV charging stations
  - User searches
  - Predictions history
  - City data
  - Feedback reports

Create APIs:
- GET /api/spots → list parking spots
- GET /api/ev-stations → list EV charging stations
- POST /api/predictions → save prediction data
- GET /api/cities → list supported cities
- POST /api/feedback → user reports

Frontend must fetch data from backend APIs instead of hardcoded arrays.

========================
3) EV CHARGING STATION MODULE ⚡
========================

Add a dedicated EV Charging feature:

Map Features:
- Show EV charging stations on the map with special icons.
- Filter by:
  - Fast charging
  - Normal charging
  - Availability (simulated)
- Show nearest EV stations based on user location.

Dashboard Features:
- EV station list with distance and status.
- “Navigate to Charger” button.

Data Model:
- Station name
- Location (lat, lng)
- Charger type
- Availability status
- Power rating (kW)

========================
4) ADVANCED SMART CITY FEATURES
========================

Add more related smart mobility features:

A) Smart Parking Zones
- Mark zones as:
  - High demand
  - Medium demand
  - Low demand

B) Traffic Awareness
- Simulate traffic density using color-coded overlays.

C) Legal Parking Simulation
- Show “Legal / Restricted / No Parking” zones.

D) User Reporting System
- Users can report:
  - Free spot
  - Blocked spot
  - Illegal parking

E) Parking History & Analytics
- Show charts:
  - Most searched areas
  - Peak parking times
  - City-wise demand

========================
5) UI/UX PROFESSIONAL UPGRADE 🎨
========================

Redesign the UI to look like a real Smart City dashboard:

Layout:
- Fixed navbar at top.
- Sidebar for filters and features.
- Main map area in center.
- Right-side panel for predictions and details.

Design System:
- Consistent spacing (8px, 16px, 24px).
- Uniform card sizes and typography.
- Smooth animations and transitions.
- Professional icons for parking and EV stations.
- Responsive layout (mobile + desktop).

Visual Improvements:
- Heatmap overlay for parking probability.
- Smooth marker animations.
- Better color coding:
  - Green = High availability
  - Yellow = Medium
  - Red = Low

========================
6) ARCHITECTURE & CODE QUALITY
========================

Refactor code into:

Frontend:
- /components (Map, Sidebar, Cards, Modals, EVPanel)
- /services (LocationService, PredictionService, ApiService)
- /styles (theme, layout, components)

Backend:
- /server (Express API)
- /database (models and seed data)

Ensure:
- Clean, readable, well-commented code.
- No duplicated logic.
- Modular and scalable architecture.

========================
7) FINAL GOAL
========================

Transform SpotLight AI into a realistic Smart Mobility platform that includes:

- Smart parking prediction
- EV charging station discovery
- Navigation and routing
- Smart city analytics
- Real backend + database
- Professional UI/UX

The final product should look like a real startup-level Smart City web application, not a simple student demo.
