You are a senior full-stack engineer and UI/UX designer.

Build a professional Smart City web application called “SpotLight AI – Smart Parking Prediction Platform”.

GOAL:
Create a modern, responsive, and visually clean website that helps users find and predict street parking availability using real-time location, maps, and AI-inspired logic.

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React + Vite (or React in Replit)
- Styling: Modern CSS (Flexbox + Grid) with a clean design system
- Maps: OpenStreetMap with Leaflet (no paid API required)
- Location: Browser Geolocation API
- Architecture: Modular React components and services

========================
CORE FEATURES
========================

1) Real-Time Location System (India-wide)
- Detect user’s live device location using Geolocation API.
- Show current city/state (reverse geocoding).
- Fallback to default city if permission denied.
- Works anywhere in India.

2) Interactive Map (Leaflet)
- Display OpenStreetMap using Leaflet.
- Show user location marker.
- Show destination marker.
- Show multiple suggested parking spots near destination.
- Draw route line from user location to destination (simulated or polyline).
- 5-block radius circle around destination.

3) Uber-like Destination Search
- Input box to search destination (city, area, place).
- Update map when destination changes.
- Recalculate suggested parking spots dynamically.

4) Smart Parking Prediction Engine (AI Simulation)
- Generate parking probability scores based on:
  - Distance from destination
  - Time of day
  - Randomized AI logic
- Categorize spots as High / Medium / Low probability.
- Display predictions in a clean dashboard panel.

5) AI Parking Insights Panel
- “Best Spot Recommendation”
- “Estimated Time-to-Park”
- “Traffic Density Indicator”
- “Legal Parking Status (simulated)”

6) Professional Dashboard UI/UX
- Layout structure:
  - Header/Navbar
  - Hero section
  - Dashboard cards
  - Map section
  - Prediction sidebar
  - Footer
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for perfect alignment.
- No overlapping elements.
- Consistent spacing and typography.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

7) UI Design System
- Smart City theme (blue/white/grey)
- Card-based UI
- Consistent button sizes (primary, secondary)
- Badges for probability (High/Medium/Low)
- Subtle animations and hover effects.

8) Advanced Features (Bonus)
- “Navigate” button → open Google Maps directions link.
- City selector dropdown.
- Dark mode toggle.
- Multi-language ready UI (English, future Hindi support).
- Real-time refresh of predictions.
- Parking heatmap overlay (simulated).

========================
CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
========================

- Clean folder structure:
  /components
  /services
  /styles
- Reusable components: Card, Button, Badge, Map, Sidebar.
- Separate logic from UI.
- Well-commented code.
- Avoid hardcoded layouts and messy CSS.

========================
FINAL RESULT
========================

The final website should look like a real Smart City startup product (similar to Google Maps / Uber / Waze style dashboards), not a random demo.

Focus on:
- Perfect alignment
- Clean UI/UX
- Modular architecture
- Realistic AI behavior
- India-wide location support.
